This tiny application uses PHP, javascript, jQuery, CSS and HTML5.
I used the AmazonECS php library for post search on Amazon. I collect
all the info through a $.post in jquery on the search.php file
transmitting keyword and page as INPUT data and recieveing a json object
with the results from Amazon.
